# GateMaster Project History & Reference Document

## Project Overview
Goal: Create an automated gate management system for apartments and houses using FASTag (RFID) technology.

---

## 1. Initial Request & Requirements
**User Prompt:** Create an app that makes the gates of apartments or houses automated.
**Requirements Identified:**
- Use FASTag (UHF RFID) technology to repurpose existing vehicle tags.
- Dashboard for monitoring logs and managing authorized vehicles.
- Hardware documentation and cost analysis.
- Live simulation of gate movements (Opening, Open, Closing, Closed).

---

## 2. Technical Specification
**Backend (Python/FastAPI):**
- Background thread for Serial communication with UHF RFID Readers.
- GPIO control for triggering physical relays (Raspberry Pi compatible).
- Local JSON database (`gate_data.json`) for vehicle registration and logs.
- REST API for frontend communication.

**Frontend (React/TypeScript):**
- Dashboard with real-time statistics (Traffic intensity, health status).
- Simulation tool for testing entry/exit scans manually.
- Vehicle Registry for adding/removing authorized FASTags.
- Professional Project Report view optimized for PDF generation/printing.

## 4. Production Security & Safety Recommendations
- **Fail-Safe Relay:** Ensure the relay pulse is short (1s) to prevent burning out the gate controller.
- **Safety Photocells:** Mandatory for residential areas to detect non-metallic objects (kids, cycles).
- **Online UPS:** High-quality power prevents the Raspberry Pi from corrupting its SD card during power cycles.
- **Surge Protection:** Essential for hardware longevity in tropical climates with thunderstorms.
